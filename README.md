### Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the final project for Week 4 of the coursera course __Getting and Cleaning Data__

The goal was to take the test and training data, add the correct labels, combine them into a single data set, and then get the average for each activity/subject combination.

Please see the [CodeBook.md](/CodeBook.md) for a detailed description of how the code works.
