#  Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the final project for Week 4 of the coursera course __Getting and Cleaning Data__

The goal was to take the test and training data, add the correct labels, combine them into a single data set, and then get the average for each activity/subject combination.

Please see the [CodeBook.md](/CodeBook.md) for a detailed description of how the code works.

## Running 

Simply run the ```run_analysis.R``` script from top to bottom and you should receive the summary as an output in the _out/_ directory.  I have included the output for the completed run in the _out/_ directory, but feel free to rename or delete this file and run it for yourself.
